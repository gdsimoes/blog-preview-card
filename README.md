## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first Frontend Mentor project in a while and I was focusing mostly on improving my workflow and getting comfortable with some tools. I used a lot of GitHub features, tried to become more comfortable with Figma (including the VS Code extension) and learned how to use `FFmpeg` to create a GIF from a video.

### Continued development

Since I did this project mostly to review and practice I refrained from using Flexbox, Grid and other advanced CSS features or JavaScript. For the next few projects I plan to increase the number of features and technologies I use.

### Useful resources

-   [Learning Git](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-git/9781098133900/) - This book helped me become proficient in Git.
-   [How to convert video to animated GIF using FFmpeg](https://shotstack.io/learn/convert-video-gif-ffmpeg/) - This is a great article that not only gave the right commands to do what I wanted but explained in simple terms every single step.
